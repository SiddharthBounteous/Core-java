error  and exceptions
1. error-> outofmemory, memoryoverflow(JVM based mostly)

failfast and failsafe

exception: any failure in business logic
(not a part of jvm)

throw-> you can catch exception in the called method itself  (program will continue to run)

throws-> you can propagate the exception to the calling method itself

we generally see error codes, then see only stack trace

log.error()

finally is used for closing connections and clearing resources.
